## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Default AWS region us-east-2 (Bedrock latency-optimized)
- Lazy singleton pattern for AWS clients (matches twilio.ts style)
- [AWS] log prefix for consistency
- Lookup table for mulaw decode (faster than algorithm)
- G.711 +0/-0 silence representation handled in tests

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Human verification needed for Phase 1:
1. AWS credentials authentication test (requires live credentials)
2. Claude 3.5 model availability in Bedrock console (requires AWS console access)
